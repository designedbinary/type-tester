# GDPR Compliance: What Organizations Need to Know

With the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) going into effect on May 25th, 2018, companies have less than a year to get ready, and many are starting to panic. Europe has been a leader in data security and privacy requirements, but GDPR compliance raises the stakes, with stricter rules, heavier fines and broad jurisdiction within the EU.

<span class="sixteenpx">But the new regulations are not as daunting as they seem. Privacy and data protection rules have been getting stricter and enforcement has been getting tougher for years, and most companies are already required to [secure business data](https://www.virtru.com/blog/secure-business-data/) against hackers and other threats. Here’s why you shouldn’t panic just yet.</span>

## GDPR Checklist: 5 Reasons Not to Panic

### 1. GDPR is what you’re already doing under compliance requirements.

GDPR compliance will likely require significant investment and retraining, but it shouldn’t be brand new. Most compliance regimes already have strict requirements for how you have to treat certain kinds of personal data. If you’re PCI compliant (which most businesses are) there are strict requirements for everything you do with credit card data. You need to encrypt it, only use it in certain systems that have been designed for it, restrict who can access it as much as possible, and submit to quarterly checks for network vulnerabilities.

  * woo, lists!

### 2. GDPR is an opportunity to unify your data protection strategy.

For many companies, the most difficult and costly thing about compliance isn’t so much the strictness of the requirements, but the sheer range of requirements. A diversified enterprise could easily be on the hook for half a dozen major compliance regimes, and dozens more different state and regional data privacy and security laws, that you may not even be aware of.

Jurisdictional boundaries are complex and haven’t been thoroughly tested yet, but you’re theoretically on the hook for data protection laws anywhere you sell a product, even if you don’t operate there.

# Here is an h1 heading
## A wild h2 heading suddenly appears
### You used h3, its super effective
#### It's over h4, I have the high ground
##### He's the h5 Gotham NEEDS, but not the one it DESERVES right now
###### I'm gonna make him an h6 he can't refuse.

There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you." Now... I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, that meant your ass. You'd be dead right now. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. See, now I'm thinking: maybe it means you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here... he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or it could mean you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. And I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin', Ringo. I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.
